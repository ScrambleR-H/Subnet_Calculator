# PhishGuard — Threat Intelligence System

## Overview

**PhishGuard** is an interactive, AI-inspired email threat analyzer built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It allows users to paste email content and instantly evaluate its safety level, providing a detailed risk assessment, visual threat radar, and actionable recommendations.

This project demonstrates advanced front-end development skills including dynamic UI updates, animations, and real-time interactive visualizations, making it a strong addition to any web development portfolio.

Disclaimer

PhishGuard is designed for educational and demonstration purposes only. The analysis results may not always be fully accurate because the project currently uses a free-tier AI API, which can have limitations in reliability, rate limits, and detection precision.

This tool should not be used as the sole basis for security decisions in real-world or production environments.
